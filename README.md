## Installation

If you just want to use the latest version of Bunpro Companion on your Chrome browser, you can directly install the extension from the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wanikani-companion/plfjbbakjphlkdpcdpodaedhicoaloph).

Otherwise, if you want to load the extension from the source code:

 1. Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:  The menu's icon is three horizontal bars. and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).
 2. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
 3. Click "Load unpacked extension" to pop up a file-selection dialog.
 4. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.
 5. Have fun!

For more details about Chrome extensions, Bunpro and development for Bunpro, I suggest you to check:

- the [official documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) for Chrome extensions,
- the Bunpro [website](https://bunpro.jp) and [API documentation](https://bunpro.jp/api).

/!\ This app integrates a frame of the official HTTPS Bunpro website (https://bunpro.jp); using another Bunpro extension at the same time may affect your experience.
